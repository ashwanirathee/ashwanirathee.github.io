I am Ashwani Rathee, Masters of Science in Computer Science Student at UC Santa Cruz with a strong focus on advancing my expertise in computer vision, computer graphicsm, software engineering and embedded systems. My journey in technology began with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology from Panjab University, where I cultivated a solid foundation in software development and problem-solving.

My professional experience includes working as a Software Engineer at FleetSafe India, where I specialize in embedded systems, particularly in radar technology. Prior to this role, I contributed as an Engineering Intern at the same company, gaining hands-on experience in hardware-software integration.

In addition to my industry experience, I have actively contributed to the open-source community. As a Google Summer of Code developer with JuliaImages, I collaborated with the Julia community under the guidance of Johnny Chen to enhance imaging tools in Julia.

With a blend of academic achievements, industry experience, and a passion for innovation, I am eager to contribute to projects at the intersection of software, embedded systems, and AI-driven solutions.
